[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

Task: Evaluate whether the numbers generated by random.random are uniformly distributed

Approach: Generate 1000 numbers from random.random, plot the pmf and cdf of the distribution

First, import packages:

```python
import numpy as np
import thinkstats2
import thinkplot
```

Generate the distribution with n=1000:

```python
rand_dist = np.random.random(1000)
```

Use ADs functions to compute the pmf and cdf:

```python
pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(rand_dist)
cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(rand_dist)
```

Use ADs plotting functions to generate the plots:

```python
thinkplot(pmf, linewidth=0.1)
thinkplot(cdf)
```

![Cdf](exercise_4_1_cdf.png)

The distributions are indeed uniform!
